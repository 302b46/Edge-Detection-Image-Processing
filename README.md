# Edge-Detection-Image-Processing

This repository consists of mini python programs that implement multiple edge-detection techniques as well as a document explaining the results and comparing between the different techniques. 

Methods:
  1. Gradient Edge Detection (Robert's, Sobel, and Prewitt)
  2. Laplacian of Gaussian
  3. Canny Edge Detection
